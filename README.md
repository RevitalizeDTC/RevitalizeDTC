How Does Revitalize Hair Serum Work? 
-------------------------------------

[Revitalize DTC Hair Regrowth](https://groups.google.com/g/revitalize-dtc-hair-regrowth/c/ePn8U1ZNSmM) is a blend of multiple natural oils that support hair health. It is safe for all hair types and individuals of all ages. In addition, it works perfectly for both men and women. How does it regrow and strengthen the hair? 

According to Sandy DeRose, most people shed hair and develop scalp issues because of hormonal imbalance, lack of specific nutrients, toxins, and poor hair hygiene. Revitalize DTC from DeRose Health is a blend of multiple oils and is scientifically proven to tackle hair and scalp problems from the root. Below is how the hair regrowth serum works: 

Balance Hormones 
-----------------

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a male-dominant hormone that weakens the hair roots, promoting hair loss. It also thins and irritates the scalp hence stimulating various hair issues. The Revitalize DTC Hair Regrowth comprises natural oils like pumpkin oil that lower and eliminate unhealthy DHT chemicals. 

**Fight Toxins** – Revitalize DTC Hair Regrowth is rich in antioxidants and polyphenols that can fight free radicals under the scalp. In addition, it can protect the hair cells against oxidative damage. Fortified cellular health promotes the growth of hair. 

**Improve Blood Flow** – Inhibited blood circulation may hinder specific hair cells from receiving adequate nourishment and oxygen. Sandy DeRose recommends massaging the scalp with Revitalize DTC Hair Regrowth to augment blood flow and strengthen the hair follicles. 

**Increase Moisture Retention** – The Revitalize DTC serum improves the moisture levels in the scalp and hair roots. Consequently, it can inhibit excessive breakage and may augment the color and texture of the hair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DeRose Health claims that each ingredient in the Revitalize DTC serum is carefully sourced, extracted, and processed. The formulation is in the correct combination to give users quality results. In addition, Revitalize has zero fillers, GMOs, irritants, scents, and other harmful components. The active ingredients include: 

**Pumpkin Seed Oil** – The Revitalize creator refers to this ingredient as the “Halloween Trick and Star” ingredient in the serum. It is clinically proven to enhance hair health, particularly in women. It works by limiting the levels of DHT hormone. Revitalize argues that most aging folks have high DHT levels that cause hair thinning and breakages. 

**Pumpkin seed** oil blocks DHT production and strengthens the hair follicles. In addition, the natural oil has phytosterols that actively block enzymes that stimulate hair loss. The ingredient may also soothe the scalp and improve blood circulation. 

**Argan Oil** – Also referred to as "Liquid Oil," the plant-based extract is typical in ancient beauty products. According to scientific breakthroughs, Argan oil improves hair health by increasing moisturization levels. Revitalize creator reasons that lack of adequate moisture weakens and thins the hair strands leading to breakages and hair loss. Argan oil improves the moisture content in the hair, thus hindering excessive breakages. 

**Argan oil has vitamin E** that may prevent hair damage from constantly styling and dying. It also enhances follicle growth and may increase your mane's volume. Regular use may result in glowing, thicker, and fuller hair. 

**Hemp Seed Oil** – Revitalize DTC Hair Regrowth makers use the ingredient to moisturize and strengthen the hair. It can minimize hair breakages and improve the scalp. Additionally, hemp seed oil has phytosterols, minerals, and antioxidants to stimulate hair growth. It improves the hair shaft's diameter, thus increasing hair volume.

**Apricot Kernel Oil** – Sandy DeRose refers to this ingredient as the 'jack of all trades.' Several vitamins, including A, E, and C, support healthy inflammation, combat aging, and may protect the scalp from bacterial infections. Additionally, Revitalize exfoliates the scalp allowing the other oils in Revitalize DTC Hair Regrowth to perform their functions. 

**Apricot Kernel oil** can soften the hair, improve its texture, and increase its length. It also has anti-inflammatory properties and may combat oxidative damage. 

**Vitamin E Oil** – Apart from amplifying the immune response, vitamin E can support cellular regeneration when used externally. Revitalize maker claims that it can protect the skin against harmful ultraviolet rays. In addition, it minimizes damage to the hair follicles and roots after using styling and coloring chemicals. 

**Vitamin E Oil** – This may aid in restoring hair health. It works by lowering unhealthy inflammations and improving blood circulation in the scalp. Revitalize DTC Hair Regrowth maker claims it may stop premature aging and enhance the hair texture and sheen. 

**Avocado Oil** – People have used avocado oil historically to augment hair health. It encourages new hair growth and may improve the length of the hair shafts. It has oleic acid and monounsaturated fats that penetrate the hair shaft and moisturize the scalp. Additionally, avocado oil has multiple vitamins that may fight unhealthy oxidation. 

**Almond Oil** – Also known as the "Goddess Oil," is proven to improve hair sheen and texture. Almond oil is a natural emollient that enhances cellular health and improves moisturization. It can prevent the hair from becoming brittle and porous. Almond oil can eliminate split ends and enhance hair volume. 

**Grapeseed Oil** – It has a high resveratrol concentration to develop the scalp hair. Grapeseed oil can speed hair growth and strengthen hair follicles. Grapeseed oil supports healthy aging and serves as an anti-inflammatory. Revitalize maker claims that it can soothe scalp irritation and minimize hair breakages.
